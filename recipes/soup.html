            <h3>A cozy and lemony chicken soup with farro,
                white beans, and kale.</h3>
            <p>By adding kale, white beans, farro, and lots of
                lemon, this recipe brings new life to store-bought
                chicken broth. Prep time is about 1 hour and 10
                minutes alltogether. Serves 4.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>2 large carrots (about 10 ounces), coarsely 
                    chopped</li>
                <li>2 onions, coarsely chopped, divided</li>
                <li>12 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, divided</li>
                <li>1 leftover roasted chicken carcass 
                    or 1 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
                <li>10 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups whole farro</li>
                <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
                <li>1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained,
                     rinsed</li>
                <li>1 cup thinly sliced Tuscan kale</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped dill</li>
                <li>1 baguette, sliced, toasted</li>
                <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over 
                    medium-high. Cook carrots, half of the 
                    onion, and 3 sliced garlic cloves, 
                    stirring occasionally, until softened and 
                    lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add chicken 
                    carcass, if using, and broth; cover and simmer 
                    30 minutes. (If you're not using carcass, 
                    simmer 15 minutes.)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, toast farro in another large pot over 
                    medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it 
                    starts to brown and smells nutty, about 3 
                    minutes. Stir in 1 tsp. salt and 3 cups water.
                     Cover and simmer until farro is tender and 
                     liquid evaporates, about 30 minutes; strain 
                     any remaining liquid, if necessary. Set 
                     aside 2 cups farro for another use.</li>
                <li>Strain chicken broth mixture through a fine-mesh
                     sieve into a large bowl; discard carcass and 
                     vegetables. Set aside 2 cups broth for
                     another use.</li>
                <li>Wipe out pot, then heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil
                     over low. Cook remaining onion and 9 sliced 
                     garlic cloves, stirring occasionally, until 
                     tender and light golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 
                     remaining broth left in bowl, increase heat 
                     to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Add 
                     reserved chicken meat, beans, kale, lemon 
                     juice, pepper, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. salt 
                     and farro left in pot; cook until vegetables 
                     are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Divide soup among bowls. Stir 1 Tbsp. 
                    salsa verde into each bowl, if using, 
                    and sprinkle with dill. Serve with 
                    baguette slices and lemon wedges alongside.</li>
