7/6/22 - My first TOP project.
The goal is to build a simple, HTML-only
recipe website. I will use all HTML elements
I have learned up to this point for
images, links, basic formatting, etc. Later,
I will update the recipe website with CSS and
maybe Javascript.

7/9/22 - Added basic CSS including a Google font,
background color, and simple formatting.
